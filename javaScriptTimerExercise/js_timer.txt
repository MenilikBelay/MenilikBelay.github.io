1. The difference between setTimeout (booyah, 2000) and setTimeout (booyah(), 2000) is that the first one
passes function as a parameter: hence, the function will be executed after 2sec. The latter one, however, will
resolve the function (call booyah) right away (without waiting 2sec) and expect to execute something returned (if possible)
from the the booyah function. 


2. They both display 6.


3. 
// CODE 
const booyah1 = function () {
    alert ('BOOYAH!');
};

const booyah2 = function () {
    return booyah1;
};

setTimeout (booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout (booyah2(), 2000);
// CODE



4. Unobtrusive javascript is when we distinguish the script code from the html code. Instead of scattering javascript code 
into our html, we isolate our content (html) from our script (javascript). One of the practical application of 
unobtrusive javascript is code readablity and our code being easily fixed in case of refactor. All we need to do 
is change the JS code or HTML code without affecting the other. The other practicality is working as a group, 
task can be easily divided and people can focus on their individual task (script writters will focus on javascript, while 
content writters will focus on html).
