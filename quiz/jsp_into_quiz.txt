1.What is the main value of Java Server Pages? 

Answer: The main value of having JSPs is it will allow us to write a code that is less error prone to Servlets still having 
the HTML code and the java code. The benefit of JSPs to Servlets is that it will include more presentation layer code (HTML) 
and reduce the burden of writing multiple lines of println expressions. We will have a more readable dynamic page that uses the power
of both HTML and Java. 

2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?

Answer: JSP pages are compiled into servlets before their first instantiation. When the browser calls the JSP, the 
container will compile the JSP into Servlets and then the lifecycle methods continue. Hence, JSPs are HTML pages embedding
java code that will later on get compiled and converted into Servlet.

3.How are JSP pages related to HTML? 

Answer: JSPs contain HTML. The main purpose of having JSPs are writing html pages that embedd java into it (using tags). 

4.Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet . 

Answer: scriptlet is an element of JSP. Anything written in scriptlet tags will get inserted into  _jspService method (similar to 
service method of Servlets). 
For Example: <% System.out.println("hello"); %> will be in JSP servlet's service method as
public void _jspService (...) { // request and response parameters skipped
    System.out.println("hello");
}

5.Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.

Answer: JSP declaration is also a jsp element that will be converted into class attribute (field) or method.
For Example: <%! int age = 24; %>   // will convert to 
public class SERVLET_NAME extends HttpServlet {
    int age = 24;
}

6.Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. 

Answer: JSP comment is also an element of JSP. The comment, however, is converted into html comments and is placed 
in the same place as the html location written in the JSP.  
For Example: <h1> ... </h1><%-- This is comment --%><p>...</p>

public void _jspService (...) {
    JspWritter out = ... ;
    out.println("<h1> ... </h1>");
    out.println("<%-- This is comment --%>");
    out.println("<p>...</p>");
}


7.   Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. 

Answer: JSP expressions are used to put things in the print statement of JspWritter. The out writter will be in _jspService method.
For Example: <%= 100 %> will be out.println(100);

8.Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. 

Answer: JSP directives are used to tell the jsp container that we need something. It's means of communication between jsp and container. 
For Example: <%@ import='hello.java' %> will be interpreated as an import statement for the converted servlet. 

9.Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.

Answer: EL expressions are evaluated in hierarchical manner. It first checks if it is implicit EL object, then checks 
page scope attributes, then request level, then session level and finally application level. If it is not found, it will 
ignore it and not resolve the expression at all. 

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.

Answer: Servlet attributes can be accessed by EL expressions. When the container resolves EL expressions, it
will check all the servlet attributes in hierarchy. But first, it will check implicit and page level attributes
before moving up to servlet attributes. 

11.Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact. 

Answer: When using request dispatch, the request is either forwarded or included between the servlet and JSP. This 
allows the passage of the request object (modified or not) from one to the other. The dispatch is resolved by 
the container.
