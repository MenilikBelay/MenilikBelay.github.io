2. In JavaScript, a method is a function inside an object while a function is by itself an object. Methods have no meaning 
and existance without an object, while functions (excluding internal functions that live inside another function) have life. 
In some terminology, functions can be elements of window object (global object in JS) directly,while methods are found inside
an object that is inside window object. 

3. 'this' in java refers to fields and methods the class holds that are not static.

4. In JavaScript this refers to attributes the object has, but if not found in side the given object,
it will directly starts referring from the window object. 

5. this in JavaScript constructor refers to attributes we want to have for the new object to be created. It 
specifies which fields to include as public in the object to be returned. 

6. since x is a prototype and f is defined inside of x, and called using x (like x.f()); then 'this' keyword
will try to find attributes from the x object and if not found, it will check the global object. 

7. a free variable is a variable that's not defined in a function's scope. It comes from outter scope and is valid
inside the function.

const newObject = {
    name: 'fred', 
    major: 'music', 
    func: (x, y) => (x === y) ? x * y : Math.min(x, y)
}
