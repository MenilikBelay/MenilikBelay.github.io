In jQuery, a jQuery function is the function $() or jQuery(). When we start selecting elements with $, we are 
calling a function which will in turn return new jQuery object. It is a fact that in javascript, functions are objects, 
so $ and jQuery by themselves have properties and methods like $.support. We can maniuplate the returned objects from 
$() to apply things on the selected element.
