1. All the three code fragments are equivalent. They are equivalent even if they have different parameters because 
i. In JavaScript you can declare as many parameters as you want, but on run time, the ones having arguments or defaults 
have data; the rest is undefined. 
ii. The each method passes two arguments into the function we passed (the callback function). Either we use it or not is 
up to us. In the first code, we use 'e'; the current instance to the specific 'li' element. In the second and third, even if 
the parameters are different, we use 'this' to refer to the specific context. 

2. 

$('div').has('ul').css({'background-color': 'red'});


3. 

$('body').append('<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>');
